# hs-wincards
Homestuck based cards.dlls for early windows cards programs. Includes all the resources I used to make them.

### Please note that the .headers files contain hand written headers for these that misidentify the resource number but define custom colour tables. The beginning of file header and end of file padding (along with a bit of common data to show where I needed to put it) are separated by the plain text "CAKE" because I was hungry.
